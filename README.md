### project will be uploaded soon

A simple, C-based compiler that tokenizes, parses, and generates LLVM IR code for a custom programming language. Built with a lexer and parser using recursive descent, the project constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for semantic analysis and code generation. The backend is powered by Rust and the inkwell library to output efficient LLVM IR. This compiler is designed for educational purposes to explore the fundamentals of compiler design and code generation.

#### practices for compiler projects

#### Define the Language
###### Syntax (e.g., expressions, loops, conditionals).

###### Data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings).

###### Basic operations (e.g., arithmetic, logical).

###### Tools: Consider using BNF (Backus-Naur Form) to define the grammar

#### 2. Lexical Analysis (Tokenizer)

#### 3. Syntax Analysis (Parser)
